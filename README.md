# JavaScript Concepts: Scope, Closures, Hoisting, and Debugging

This repository contains JavaScript code snippets to illustrate key concepts including Scope, Closures, Hoisting, and Debugging.

## Scope

Scope refers to the context in which variables are declared and accessed in a program. It defines the visibility and accessibility of variables. 

## Closures

Closures occur when a function is defined within another function and has access to the outer (enclosing) function's variables.

## Hoisting

Hoisting is a behavior in JavaScript where variable and function declarations are moved to the top of their containing scope during the compilation phase.

## Debugging

Debugging is the process of identifying and fixing errors or issues in your code. It involves inspecting variables, checking the flow of execution, and understanding how your code behaves
